# AI-Powered-Fraud-Detection-for-Authentication-Systems
A cutting-edge security solution that leverages machine learning and behavioral biometrics to detect and prevent fraudulent login attempts in real time. This system analyzes user interaction patternsâ€”such as mouse movements, keystroke dynamics, and login behaviorâ€”to distinguish legitimate users from potential attackers.
# Key Features  
âœ… Behavioral Biometrics â€“ Tracks unique user interactions (typing speed, mouse velocity) to create a digital fingerprint.  
âœ… Anomaly Detection â€“ Uses Isolation Forest (AI/ML) to flag suspicious login attempts.  
âœ… Real-Time Risk Scoring â€“ Dynamically assesses threat levels and triggers 2FA when needed.  
âœ… Redis-Powered Session Storage â€“ Securely stores user behavior baselines for comparison.  
âœ… JWT Authentication â€“ Ensures secure, token-based user validation.  

# How It Works
### Signup Phase â€“ Records baseline biometrics (typing/mouse patterns).  

### Login Phase â€“ Compares live behavior against stored profiles.  

### Fraud Detection â€“ AI model flags deviations (e.g., bot-like typing, unfamiliar mouse movements).  

### Response â€“ Blocks suspicious logins or escalates to 2FA.
